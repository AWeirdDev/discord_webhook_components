# discord_webhook_components
# Welcome to the discord_webhook_components wiki!
I know this is useless but ok

## Quick Start
> 1. Download the files [here](https://github.com/AWeirdScratcher/discord_webhook_components/tree/main/discord_webhook_components), or [download the zipped files](https://github.com/AWeirdScratcher/discord_webhook_components/releases/tag/discord)
> 2. Add your python file in the same directory where the downloaded file is.
> 3. Add these codes:

***VERY IMPORTANT***
```ini
[If you don't add the codes below, discord_webhook_components will not work!]
```

```py
from discord_webhook_components import * # import everything in the module
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="your command prefix")

#@client.event
#async def on_ready():
#  print("ready")

```

> ...and that's all you gotta do for the **setup**! *You can now start coding with discord_webhook_components!*

> You can try out our [examples](https://github.com/AWeirdScratcher/discord_webhook_components/tree/main/examples), too!
